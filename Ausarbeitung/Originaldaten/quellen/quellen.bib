  abstract = {Unacceptable errors in the prediction of traffic noise occur in some cases when the road surface is largely different from that on which the prediction model is based. The reason is that tyre/road noise has appeared to be the dominating component of the noise from free-flowing traffic and that this noise is to a substantial extent dependent on the road surface. The mechanisms for tyre/road noise generation and its relation to road characteristics are described. Relevant road surface characterization methods are suggested. The major method is the measurement of the road texture profile and subsequent spectral analysis of the profile curve. Supplementary methods concern the measurement of acoustical and mechanical impedances. It is concluded that the road surface effect on traffic noise is extremely complicated and that it is very difficult to generalize any simple relations. For free-flowing traffic it is shown that the tested road surface types and conditions may influence the traffic noise by up to 11 dB(A). This calls for a correction term for the road surface in the prediction models. Despite the complicated relations, it appears feasible\textemdash{}within stringent limitations\textemdash{}to use a table where the correction term is a variable of vehicle type, vehicle speed as well as road surface type and condition.},

Several previous studies have been attempted to show the effects of noise on house prices but have been inconclusive because of a failure to meet basic requirements for a rigorous analysis.

Data on 2277 individual housing transactions at 51 sites close to major roadways were analyzed to determine the effects of road traffic noise on house prices. Results show that noise has a significant and consistent effect equal to approximately \$254 per decibel depreciation at the arterial sites examined and \$312 per decibel depreciation at the expressway sites.},

A single-family house of SEK975 000 would sell for SEK650 000 if located near a road where noise is loud, equivalent to a total discount of 30\%.},

Moreover, according to EU-guidelines, determination and enforcement of differentiated noise limits will be delegated from national to local governments in the near future. The value of noise has never been this important. In this paper, we estimate the non-linear impact of traffic noise on property prices. The used data set is very extensive; over 100,000 sales transactions are studied, with many individual property characteristics, combined with noise levels for 2 million small 100 by 100 m areas. We use spatial autocorrelation techniques to overcome the regular problems of traditional NIMBY-analysis performed by hedonic regression. In a rising market, we find that the impact of traffic noise ranges to 12 percent, with an average of about 5 percent. The discount varies across sub-markets, and is a non-linear function of the noise level.},

The paper numerically demonstrates the capabilities of such a methodology in the presence of noise, changing vehicle mass, changing vehicle speeds and road defects. In order to avoid crowding out understanding of the methodology, a simple linear pitch-plane model is employed. Initially, road profiles from known roughness classes were applied to a physical model to calculate vehicle responses. The calculated responses and road profiles were used to train an artificial neural network. In this way, the network renders corresponding road profiles on the availability of fresh data on model responses. The results show that the road profiles and associated defects can be reconstructed to within a 20\% error at a minimum correlation value of 94\%.},

In this study we describe the conducted experiments with data from the time domain, frequency domain and wavelet transformation, and a method to reduce the effects of speed, slopes and drifts from sensor signals. A new audiovisual data labeling technique is proposed. Our system named RoADS, implements wavelet decomposition analysis for signal processing of inertial sensor signals and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for anomaly detection and classification. Using these methods we are able to build a real time multi class road anomaly detector. We obtained a consistent accuracy of $\approx\approx\backslash$approx 90 \% on detecting severe anomalies regardless of vehicle type and road location. Local road authorities and communities can benefit from this system to evaluate the state of their road network pavement in real time.},

The idea of suspension is to improve the ride quality while maintaining good handling characteristics to different road disturbance. The purpose of designing the active controller for vehicle suspension systems is to decrease the traditional design between ride and handling by directly controlling the suspension forces to suit the road and driving conditions. The presented approach uses linear controller that does not require physical model of shock absorber or the car which is time consuming to derive and implement. Performance of active suspensions like robust H∞ controller, LQR controller and Fuzzy control are compared with existing passive suspension. Simulation result shows that the active controllers are better than passive in terms of settling time.},

    abstract = { Summary This paper deals with single-wheel suspension car model. We aim to prove the benefits of controlled semi-active suspensions compared to passive ones. The contribution relies on H 8 control design to improve comfort and road holding of the car under industrial specifications, and on control validation through simulation on an exact nonlinear model of the suspension. Note that we define semi-active suspensions as control systems incorporating a parallel spring and an electronically controlled damper. However, the type of damper used in automotive industry can only dissipate energy. No additional force can be generated using external energy. The control issue is then to change, in an accurate way, the damping (friction) coefficient in real-time. This is what we call semi-active suspension. For this purpose, two control methodologies, H 8 and Skyhook control approaches, are developed, using a linear model of the suspension, and compared in terms of performances using industrial specifications. The performance analysis is done using the control-oriented linear model first, and then using an exact nonlinear model of the suspension incorporating the nonlinear characteristics of the suspension spring and damper. }

In particular, the first four classes provided by ISO 8608 were considered. Subsequently, the force exchanged between the pavement and three typologies of vehicles (car, bus and truck) has been assessed by implementing, in Matlab\textregistered, the QCM (Quarter Car Model) characterized by a quarter vehicle mass and variable speed from 20 to 100 km/h. The analysis allows determining the amount of dynamic overload that causes the vibrational stress.Results/ConclusionsThe paper shows how this dynamic overload may be predetermined as a function of the pavements surface degradation. This is a useful reference for the purposes of designing and maintaining road pavements.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic analysis of twenty four performance measures used in the complete spectrum of Machine Learning classification tasks, i.e., binary, multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical. For each classification task, the study relates a set of changes in a confusion matrix to specific characteristics of data. Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier's evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem. This formal analysis is supported by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classifiers. Text classification supplements the discussion with several case studies.},
