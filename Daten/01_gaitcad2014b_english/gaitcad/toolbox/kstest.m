%
% Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Test for the distributions
% F1(x1) and F2(x2). The significance level 'alpha' can
% be omitted; it then defaults to 0.05.
% F1, x1, F2, x2 must all be vectors; F1 and x1 must
% be the same length, F2 and x2 must also be the same length.
% F1 and F2 must be strict monotonically ascending functions,
% i.e. every x-value is assigned a unique F-value and vice versa.
%
% To compare an empirical distribution with a 'true' distribution,
% set 'x2 = []' (empty matrix). Then, F1 and F2 must be the same 
% length and it is assumed that F2 is the 'true' distribution and 
% given at the points x1.
% 
% 'q' is the test value of the KS-Test, and 'c' is the value to 
% compare. E.g., let alpha be 0.05, and q > c, then we can say
% that the two compared distributions are different with a 
% probability of at least 0.95.
%
% F(x) = 0 for x < min{x}
% F(x) = 1 for x > max{x}
% This is true for empirical F's and a good approximation
% for sampled 'true' F's if the amount of samples N is
% large enough.
